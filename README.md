api.py manages the html methods using Flask.

api.py stores and manages data using a database class which is built around elasticsearch.

The elasticsearch host is the localhost port 9200 by default. 

This can by running api.py with an alternative host as a commandline argument.

ex.  python api.py http://127.0.0.1:5000
